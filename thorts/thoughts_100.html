<h1>Some Thorts&trade; on The Hundred Line</h1>

<p>
So. I'm actually writing this. I've been thinking about writing this for
a while now, but I assumed it'd just remain a thought. I doubt I'll publish
this, but in case I do, um... hi. You're in for whatever the opposite of a 
treat is. A taert? I don't know.
</p>

<p>
First thing you should know: I'm a horrible writer. I've always sucked at
writing. I'll also likely be rambling on randomly and not stay on topic.
</p>

<p>
So. Anyway. What was I going to talk about? Oh, right, Hundred Line. I have
some thorts(tm) about some of the branching nature of this game, and how
the branches seem to have been written.
</p>

<p>
Okay, but why am I writing this? Alright, time to publicly embarrass myself.
I'm mad that a character died. I should really know better than to expect something
else from Kodaka at this point, but I keep falling for it. It'd be nice
if it didn't trigger a depressive episode again, but what can you do.
</p>

<p>

(unfortunately I couldn't find a good one)
</p>

<p>
Now I know what you're thinking. "You're just coming up with some points post-hoc
to justify your anger. You wouldn't think that way if the opposite occurred."
</p>

<p>
Yup. Yep. Uh-huh. You're 100% correct, hypothetical reader. That is exactly what
is happening here. That's right, it's time for...
</p>

<img src="imgs/motivated.png" alt="MOTIVATED COGNITION!" title="(insert GTA2 voice here)">

<p>
Yup, I'm about to say a bunch of things that I wouldn't be saying otherwise if the game
was written differently. And yes, I am basically complaining that the game wasn't
written the way I wanted. But who knows, maybe I might come up with a point that's
actually interesting.
</p>

<p>
Also note that I'll probably be updating this over time. I just wanted to post
something asap, even if it isn't done. 
</p>

<p>
Anyway, from here on out, spoilers for the general structure of Hundred Line and
specific spoilers for certain routes and decisions. Also maybe some spoilers for
Danganronpa 1/2/V3.
</p>

<p>
Note that I have not played all branches (I only have 30 endings so far*), but
I have looked at guides on how to get all possible endings, so I know the general
structure.
</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>

<p>
In case you haven't played Hundred Line and just want to get the gist of it: you can
look up the synopsis from any listing for the game. Basically, you have to defend this
academy for 100 days, after which, something happens. You don't have any choices during
these 100 days, so there's a set path. Except then you go back in time to try and do things
over. This second run through there are A LOT of choices.  Depending on the choices you take,
there are 100 possible endings. But the thing is... those choices aren't always weighted equally. 
Sometimes this makes perfect sense; making a terrible choice can easily lead you to a quick ending. 
However, it becomes an issue when a more-or-less equal choice has incredibly lopsided outcomes. 
Like, let's say one option leads to 2 possible endings, while the other leads to 40 possible endings.
</p>

<p>
However, there is a reason why this is. There is one "main" route (ending 1), and the other routes
essentially branch off from it. While this isn't necessarily a problem, it does mean that there are
times when you can tell that the story was written expecting you to make a certain decision. This
is especially galling when making the ""wrong"" choice leads to an obvious choice point, but then
the game just makes the choice for you.
</p>

<p>
To be fair, I think part of this is part of the game's design philosophy: the writers didn't want
there to be routes that are efffectively the same, just with one character swapped out for another.
If they did this, it would feel like filler for getting to 100 endings. Alternatively, they could
have made more than 100 endings, but just label the ones at the swap ending 1A/1B, etc... 
</p>


<p>
So. Anyway. Kyoshika Magadori. My favourite character in the game. You've probably already figured
out why I'm mad about this based on what I've written so far. On Day 15 of the main route, you
have to choose from one of three Characters to sacrifice themself to detonate a bomb: Takemaru, Tsubasa, 
or Kyoshika. 
</p>

<p>
Part of my issue with this choice is that the game isn't really interested in <i>why</i> you would choose
one character over the other (at least as far as I've seen so far). For a lot of people playing the game
for the first time, I imagine they'd just sacrifice whichever character they like less. But you could 
also view it as a value judgement: 
</p>

<p>
Who would you sacrifice: Someone who's had a (relatively) normal and fulfilled life, or someone
who's lived almost completely isolated from society and hasn't had ... Now, obviously I'm putting
my thumb on the scale with those descriptions, but I still think they're somewhat applicable.
What's annoying is that the game doesn't seem to acknowledge this; if you choose to sacrifice
Takemaru, his only reasoning for being picked over Kyoshika is that she's a girl. While this is
very much in line with Takemaru's personality and thought processes, it's also kind of insulting
to Kyoshika. Honestly, it probably would have been better if Takemaru wasn't an option to sacrifice;
it would make more sense for Kyoshika to be the "canonical" choice. (It doesn't help that the only
route you can get from sacrificing Takemaru is the Sex Cult route, which is kinda insulting).
</p>

<p>
(I'll continue this point later)
</p>

<p>
Okay, back to the point about the game not really being interested in the reasonings for one's choice.
In the V'ehxness route, Tsubasa (and the game, by extension, I think? I'd have to play the whole route
over again) doesn't consider the possibility that the reason Takumi/the Player chose her was that they
believed she wouldn't be able to go through with it, as a roundabout way of avoiding sacrificing anyone.
</p>


<h3>Other points I'll expand on later</h3>

<p>
It's kind of odd to not have her in the route for ending 1, considering that that route
(apparently) focuses on the Flaming Boy (Shion). In the routes I've played so far, the two
don't have much interaction, despite their similar backgrounds, being raised isolated from
anyone else.
</p>

<p>
Also Kyoshika's sacrifice scene is pretty much a copy of Tenko's death from V3 and Peko's
death from 2. Basically, a character with low self-worth dies/sacrifices herself and isn't
appreciated by the other characters until after/just before her death.
(yes I'm still mad about Tenko's death 8 years later).
</p>


<p>
Okay, now the point I can't justify, even to myself. Honestly, my favourite Kyoshika moments
are the parts where she's suffering. ...okay, maybe that makes it sound a little worse than
I what I mean, but one of my favourite moments is when Kurara sacrifices herself to save 
Kyoshika in the Zombie route. It's a great moment for both of them: Maskless Kurara overcomes
her timidity to save her <del>girl</del>friend, while Kyoshika has to reckon with someone she
loves sacrificing herself to save her. I want more moments like that. I have my issues with the
zombie route, but that moment was worth it.
</p>

<p>
Well who knows. Maybe they'll release some DLC with more routes (they won't). Oh come on,
I can dream (no you can't). I mean, that would be the smart way to ensure that not everything
is spoiled immediately right? Not releasing the whole game at the start (you're being delusional).
</p>

of the short endings I got along the way.
