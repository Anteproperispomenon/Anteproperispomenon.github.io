<h1 id="apple-pear-etc-crisp">Apple/Pear/etc... Crisp</h1>
<p>This is a basic recipe my mother has been using for a while.
Usually, you&#39;d just use apples or maybe pears as the base fruit,
but I find it more interesting when you use a mixture of fruits.</p>

<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<p>Preheat Oven to 400&deg;F or 205&deg;C. You&#39;ll need a mixing bowl for the topping/crust, a glass or aluminum baking pan 
(with edges at least ~4 inches/~10cm high), and (optionally) a bowl to mix the fruit mixture in.</p>
<h3 id="making-the-fruit-mixture">Making the Fruit Mixture</h3>
<p>If using apples/pears, peel them and then cut into slices. Prepare other
fruit as desired. Next, add non-tender* prepared fruit, flour, orange juice,
cinnamon, and maple syrup/honey to the pan/mixing bowl. Mix the fruit and
other ingredients together to distribute the flour etc... This will help
thicken the juices produces by the fruit as it bakes.</p>
<p>*Tender in this case just means fruit that would fall apart if mixed around
with a metal spoon; e.g. fresh kiwi slices.</p>
<p>After you&#39;ve finished mixing the fruit/flour/etc, transfer it to the pan
(if applicable), and then add any tender fruit you hadn&#39;t added yet.</p>
<h3 id="making-the-topping-crust-mixture">Making the Topping/Crust Mixture</h3>
<p>Chop up the nuts to desired size. Usually, I use pecans and
walnuts, but you can also use almonds. I haven&#39;t tried using 
hazelnuts, but I imagine they&#39;d taste fine. If you&#39;re feeling
adventurous, you can try using black walnuts (if you can get them).</p>
<p>Next, using the (other) mixing bowl, add the oats, flour, nuts,
cinammon, and brown sugar. Drizzle the oil/melted butter on, then
mix.</p>
<h3 id="baking">Baking</h3>
<p>Sprinkle the topping mixture evenly on top of the fruit in
the baking pan. If fruit mixture is uneven, just sprinkly a
similar depth of topping throughout the pan.</p>
<p>Bake until fruit mixture is bubbling from below the crust,
and the crust is golden brown. This is usually about 20~25
minutes. Remove from oven and let sit for about 10 minutes.</p>
